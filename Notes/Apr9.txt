Reading from a file:

If outputting to a file that doesn't exist, python will create it
If reading from a file that doesn't exist, shit will crash
So probably a good idea to test if it exists before trying to read from it

Ex.)
import os;

def main():
	filename = input("What is the name of the file? ");
	while not os.path.exists(filename): #tests if the file is there or not
		print("BAD FILENAME");
		filename = input("What is the name of the file? ");
	
	inFile = open(filename,"r");
	line = inFile.readline(); #gets one line of the file

	for line in inFile: #loops for every line in the file
		#do some stuff here


Important thing to note:
	Working with files, the next operation picks up where the last one left off
	For example, reading one line, then setting up a loop to read all lines, will result in the first line not being covered in the loop for all lines
