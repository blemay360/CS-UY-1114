Python is basically a script:
Start at beginning, go to end

But it also has functions
Python doesn't require a main() function like other languages, but it can still be usefull

Syntax:
def main(parameters):
	code block;

if __name__=="__main__":
	main();

Put everything under main() and call main with the if statement above
As to why the if statement is necessary, who knows

Print vs Return
Print prints to screen
Return delivers a variable back to whatever called it

Default values
If not provided a parameter, one will be assigned if the following syntax is followed:

def func(val1=default_val1, val2=default_val2):
	code stuff;

func(); //takes both default values
func(var); //takes value of var as val1 instead of default_val1
func(var, vary); //takes value of var as var2 and vary as var2
func(val2=var);	//takes value of var as val2
