Lists are mutable => passing a list to a function that changes it changes the original too

Tuples are immutable
('This','is','A','tuple')
It uses parathenses instead of brackets
However, it's the comma that makes it a tuple, not the parentheses
tuples can contain lists, just as lists can contain lists
Interesting note, lists can be changed inside tuples
Elements of tuples can be changed if they are mutable
Mainly just used for temp stuff

def getTuple():
	return a,b,c; //Returns a tuple with a,b,c
x,y,z=getTuple(); //Sets x,y,z to a tuple from a 

Sorting algorithms:
For example, imagine sorting shortest to tallest

Selection sort:
Selection sort will go through your entire list, finding the shortest element, and putting it at index 0, swapping whatever was at 0 with the shortest element, and moving on to index 1=>n, then 2=>n, and continuing i=>n until done
	This isn't great for performance, but it's easy to understand


Binary Search:
When looking at a sorted list for a certain value, just start in the middle
From there, you can evaluate whether the middle value is higher or lower than the value you're searching for, and eliminate half the list
Continue until value is found
This is very efficient, and will find the value in log base 2 of the number of elements in the list
