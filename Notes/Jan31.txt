Python math:
x-y = Subtraction
x*y = Multiplication
x**y= Exponents (x to the power of y)
x/y = Division (returns a float)
x//4= Division (returns an truncated int)
x%y = Modulo (returns a remainder)

The math module is a thing. Legit just look it up as needed
Other libraries also exist. Who knew?
Turtle can draw stuff in a new window, and will be needed for a lab
