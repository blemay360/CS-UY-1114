id function:
id(x)
Provides id of a variable (instead of printing the value of a variable, it will print the location of the variable (as in the physical location of the variable in main memory)
Ex.
[
x=5
print(id(x))
]
Will return something like 10919552, not 5

To not add a new line character when printing, use end=""
Ex.
[
print(string,end="");
]
Will return the string only. Doing this on two lines will print the same string twice, on the same line, with no spaces
Commas can be used to print a bunch of stuff at once. Python will give spaces between everything unless sep='' is tossed at end. The useful thing compared to using + is that variable types don't matter

Compound assignemt:
This is the whole x+=1 thing
You know this but remember that compound assignment is done last.
Ex.
[
x=6
x=x/1+1
]
x is 7
[
x=6
x/=1+1
]
x is 3

Random library
random.random() gives a random number from 0 to 1 
(not really random, it's pseudo-random. Given the same seed, the random numbers will be the same. But we have the same probability of getting any number, which is good) 
random.randint(a,b) will return a pseudo-random integer between and including a and b
random.seed(a=int) will seed the random number generator with int
