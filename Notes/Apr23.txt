Dictionaries:
List/Array, but numbered differently
Use square brackets

d['Name']=100;

Correlates the name 'Name' with the value 100
return(d['Name']); #returns the value 100

The name is referred to as a key

dictionary[key]=value;

key has to be unique, value doesn't

Don't have to append, just need to refer to a new key in definition
