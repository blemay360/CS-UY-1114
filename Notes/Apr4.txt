Files

2 types of files
	1.Ones you read from
	2.Ones you write to

Syntax
	f = open("filename.txt","w"); #opens filename.txt for writing
		#if the above line is run and filename.txt already exists, it will delete the old one and make a new filename.txt
		#changing w to a will add stuff onto it, but don't do it in this course
	print("Hello World", file=f); #writes into filename.txt
