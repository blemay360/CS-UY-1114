More stuff on dictionaries:
Usually should use simple stuff for keys: string, int, float..
Not objects or lists or stuff
Objects, however, are good for more complicated stuff

reminder:
d={}; #To initialize a dictionary
d['Daniel']=100; #To assign a value to a new key

''/"" are strings
[] are lists

d.keys gives us all the keys in dictionary
for keys in d.keys:
	#iterate over all keys in dictionary d
